# Face Recognition using Streamlit

This is a Streamlit-based face recognition project built using Python.

⚠️ This project does NOT run using IDLE or normal Python execution.
It must be executed using Streamlit.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Note

This project trains the model dynamically.  
Click the **Train Model** button in the app to generate the model.  
No pre-trained model file is included.

## Dataset

This project uses a publicly available face dataset.  
Due to copyright and size, the dataset is not included in this repository.  

You can download it here: https://github.com/robaita/introduction_to_machine_learning/blob/main/dataset.zip
After downloading, place the dataset in the `dataset/` folder before using the app.

Note: No pre-trained model file is included. The model will be created when you train it inside the app.
